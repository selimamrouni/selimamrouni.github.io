Please see [Github Repository](https://github.com/selimamrouni/framework-python-reading-of-pdf-files/edit/master/README.md)

This repository presents an example of the use of the library [slate3k](https://pypi.org/project/slate3k/) in order to automatically read pdf files and turn the data in an excel file. 

I hope it can help someone with the same issue of automation processing of pdf file !
