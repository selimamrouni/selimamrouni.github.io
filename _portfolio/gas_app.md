# gas-app
gas app web application

Please see [Github Repository](https://github.com/selimamrouni/gas-app)

This repository presents a [web-app](https://gas-app-usa.herokuapp.com/) developed based on a discussion with my father to help him make saving on the tank-filling. 
Please, the app can take some seconds to launch, this is due to Heroku which can be longer for free hosting.

You can check-out my [Medium Post](https://medium.com/@selimamrouni/leverage-french-government-open-data-to-make-savings-on-gas-tank-filling-b09ecc68a230) for more information. 

The main files are:
- gasApp_notebook.ipynb: original notebook where the pipeline has been developed

  - gasApp_backend.py: backend of the application, wrap the useful functions into a wrapped function
