This repository presents how to come-up with hexagon and arrow using the library gmplot.

During Spring 2018, I was involved in a research project in Transportation Analytics. I had to do some GPS data visualizations and especially had to plot figures (hexagons and arrows) using the amazing Python library [gmplot](https://github.com/vgm64/gmplot). This is a super easy package which enables you to draw GPS point representations, but unfortunately there is still no built-in functions for hexagons and arrows. <br>
I hope this can help you if you face the same problem ! 

## Hexagon

In this example, I point the [Alma Mater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alma_Mater_(New_York_sculpture) ) using gmplot built-in marker. Alma Mater is a French (clap clap !) designed sculpture which stands at the heart of the Columbia campus: the [Low Library steps](http://www.wikicu.com/Low_Library_stepsAnd). A super relaxing place! <br><br>
Then, I draw, as an example, a hexagon whose center is the Alma Mater.

## Arrow

Here, I show how to draw an arrow with [gmplot](https://github.com/vgm64/gmplot). It was useful to illustrate the moves of cars in the project. But here I decided to show you something even more interesting: my favorite cookie spot in the area a.k.a. [Levain Bakery](https://www.levainbakery.com/).
