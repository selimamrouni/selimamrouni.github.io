In this Medium series, we will present our work as Research Interns this Summer
2018 at [NYU Langone Health](https://nyulangone.org/).

[Part.
1](https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-hospital-bed-availability-part-1-81d75649a18c)
was about the general presentation of the problem and a description of the
hospital processes.

This article (Part. 2) will be focused on the model used for predicting the
hospital occupancy. So, here we go into the core of the project!

### Inpatients Model

#### Preliminary

**Inpatients** are already into NYU Langone premises. As they are already
admitted, the **unique goal** is to **predict** their **discharge** date. Then,
by summing the discharges within each NU, we can retrieve the number of patients
within the NU.

> Predict every day what is the remaining LoS of the patient

**Two approaches** can be implemented to predict the discharges of the patients.
**First**, we can try to **forecast directly the patient LoS** at the moment of
the admission (example: 3 days, 4 days…). However, the discharge of the patient
is very unpredictable and the estimated discharge date changes several times
during the patient care process. Indeed, the patient’s body reactions are
uncertain and nobody knows exactly how long the patient will stay, what will be
the future treatments, etc… So, **a second approach** is to **predict every
day** what is the **remaining LoS** of the patient. This is the approach we
adopted.

Also, **predicting** the **discharge** date can be seen both as a **regression**
or a **classification** problem.

> Due to the granularity required by the CTC team, we opted for a classification
> approach.

In the **regression problem**, the goal is to predict the **right amount of time
remaining** in the hospital. However, due to the granularity required by the CTC
team, **we opted for a classification approach**. Indeed, for an operational
point of view, the importance is to know every day the occupancy of the hospital
but they do not care about the exact time of the discharge. After several
reviews with the team, in addition to the day, we realized that an **important
information** to know for them is if the **discharge** will happen **before
noon** (12:00 PM). Indeed, knowing if a bed is a **Discharge Before Noon **(DBN)
enables the team to directly re-attributes this bed during the afternoon. Then,
there is no under-occupancy of the bed which will host of the patient during the
night. That is why we turned the regression problem to a classification one. We
**split the time into seven twelve-hours slot**s going from** “0–12h”** to
**“+72h”**. For example, if a patient belongs to the class “24–36h”, it means
his remaining LoS is between 24 and 36 hours. So, the problem of predicting the
number of inpatients in the hospital is turned into a **supervised seven classes
classification problem**.

#### Features used

The dataset used for this task is the Current Census. It is the snapshot view of
the hospital with about two hundreds of features. However, due to a data leak of
future data in the past data (the past data of a patient are overwritten by the
last entries), we were not able to use these features. Hopefully, after several
meetings with the I.T. team and thanks to their amazing work, we started the
capture and storage of this Current Census dataset four times a day. Thus, we
hope we will be able to try and test our methodology in future work.

At first glance, because we don’t have access to historical data, we were only
able to use one feature for our inpatients model: **the estimated discharge data
given by the physician**. Indeed, the physician during its daily patient tour
updates the estimated discharge date of the patient.

#### Processing of the data

Given the estimated discharge date by the physician and the current time, we can
compute the remaining Length of Stay of the patient. Then, knowing the remaining
amount of time the patient will stay, we can attribute each patient to the
category it belongs. The last step is counting, within each NU, the number of
patients belonging to each category in order to know the number of discharges.

**Results**

This scatters plot of the Actual Remaining LoS vs. Expected Remaining LoS
demonstrates the **inefficiency of the physician prediction.** Based on this
observation, we tried to develop a supervised learning classification algorithm.

### Scheduled Model

#### Placement Matrix

The Placement Matrix assigns a type of medicine and a level of care to a NU.

<span class="figcaption_hack">First rows of the Placement Matrix (details have been blurred for non-disclosure
agreement)</span>

We can see that in some cases there are listings of NU ( 1), 2) … ). This
describes an order of NU filling, if “1)” is full then put the patient in “2)”
and so on. We can also observe that sometimes depending on the team of surgeons
or the type of the day (weekdays, weekends or holidays) the placement can
change.

> We had to interpret raw texts…

The **format** is **not** **thought** to be **used** by **machines** but by the
human employees. We had to **interpret** raw texts. Sometimes the names of the
NU differ a bit for the same NU. We needed to find a method that dealt with
these difficulties, we could not code a simple mapping for that particular
Placement Matrix. Indeed the Placement Matrix is often changing, we needed to
**perform** an **algorithm** **robust to these changes**.

> …using a word distance…lowest number of elementary operations on ch1 needed to
> transform it into ch2

We decided to make a list of unchanged names of NU, then using a **word
distance** we associated the NU suggested by the Placement Matrix to the one
that **minimizes the distance in our list**. For this purpose, we used the
following distance: Let *ch1* and *ch2* be two chains of characters. The
distance between *ch1* and *ch2* noted *D(ch1, ch2)* is **the lowest number of
elementary operations** on *ch1* needed to **transform** it into *ch2*. There
are three elementary operations:

* Interchanging two characters (1) (ex: dog → god)
* Inserting a character (2) (ex: god → gold)
* Removing a character (3) (ex: gold → old)

For example *D(“*dog*”, “*glove*”)*= 5:

<span class="figcaption_hack">How to calculate the distance between ”dog” and “glove”</span>

This distance has been **inspired** from the famous **Levenshtein Distance**. We
**added** the operation “**interchanging**”. In our case, the chains of
characters are in fact sentences. The interchanging allows flexibility if words
are similar but not in the same order in the two sentences. We can notice that
the distance **verifies** the **widest mathematical definition of a distance**:

The results were really satisfying, none of the NU names were wrongly mapped.

#### Admissions

The admission was straightforward once we have been able to handle the Placement
Matrix correctly. We chose the hypothesis that the **patient** **enters** **his
NU in the time slot following the one of his surgery**. We did this choice in
order to take into account the length of the surgery and the time spent in the
PACU. For example, if a patient is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, therefore
in the slot “36–48h”, we will assume that he will arrive at his NU in the time
slot “48–60h”.

#### Discharges

Since we do not have yet any other information on the patient (he is not in the
hospital yet), we cannot affect him with a satisfactory accuracy a LoS.
According to his NU, we can **sample** its **LoS** based on the **historical
data**.<br> The next figure gives us the average LoS of the patients for each
unit:

agreement)</span>

#### Unscheduled Model

For the unscheduled patients, we needed to **sample** the **arrivals** in the
**Emergency Room** using the historical data.

#### Admissions

The principle is simple, in the data about patients’ discharges we can derive
the average number of arrivals per day, taking in account
day-of-the-week-**seasonality**. The figure below gives the precision about this
particular seasonality. The seasonality due to the period of the year (there are
some peaks, especially during the summer or the winter) is supposed to be
directly taken into account. Indeed we considered only the 2 last months of
discharges data. Therefore the **statistics** made **consider** only the
**current** **period** of the year.

<span class="figcaption_hack">Day-of-the-week-seasonality for the unscheduled arrivals</span>

> We need to simulate today, tomorrow and after tomorrow

Once we made statistics on the days, we know **how many unscheduled patients we
need to simulate today, tomorrow and after tomorrow**. We are even more precise:
we take into account whether it is the morning or the afternoon to fill our time
slots correctly. <br> Then, if we know we have to sample “*n*” unscheduled
arrivals in a particular time slot, we can also **assign** to this “*n*”
different patients an NU. We did this assignment using the historical data, the
next figure is illustrating the share of the NU for the unscheduled arrivals.
Based on this distribution we can easily sample our unscheduled patients (it is
just a Multinomial Distribution). We used this model to fill our inputs for the
Emergency Room arrivals.

#### Discharges

As we did for the scheduled we sample the LoS of the unscheduled patients. Then
we can derive the discharges dates of the unscheduled arrivals.

model we build for the project. In the coming articles, we will get into fancier
and more attractive mathematics to improve the model.
