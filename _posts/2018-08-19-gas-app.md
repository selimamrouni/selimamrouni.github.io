# Leverage French Government Open Data to Make Savings on Gas Tank Filling


I am Selim Amrouni, currently a student in Operations Research at Columbia
University. If you want to look deeper at the code of the project, you can go to
my [GitHub](https://github.com/selimamrouni). Feel free to contact me by
[email](mailto:selim.amrouni@columbia.edu) or on my
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/selimamrouni/) if you have any question.

In this post, I will describe you how a conversation with my father lead to a
small web-app he is now using on a weekly basis!

Please, feel free to use the [App](https://gas-app-usa.herokuapp.com/). For now,
it is only available for France but you can contact me if you want to make it
available in your country.

### Introduction

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/theme/img/post/gas_app/price_curve.jpg"  height="400">
<span class="figcaption_hack">Gazole Price Evolution</span>

Since my arrival in the USA, Gazole price has been constantly growing to reach
its highest level ever… recently my father told me:

*“You know Son, it’s always costing more and more at the gas station. Soon, I
won’t be able to drive my favorite vintage car as much as I want.”*

Here came-up the idea to build a tool for him and make him able to save some
money on his gas tank filling-up! Indeed, the French government has its own
[open-data website](https://www.prix-carburants.gouv.fr/rubrique/opendata/) with
all French gas station information and especially **10-minutes updated price
information**.

This post is the retranscription of our back-and-forth discussion this summer
while I was developing the tool which gives him **in real-time** the best gas
station to go.

<span class="figcaption_hack">Look how well he restored his vintage
[4CV.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault_4CV) He is really passionate, isn’t
he?</span>

### Download & Filter the data

The dataset is directly downloadable and readable in an
[XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) format. It is a widely used format
which is readable by both a human and a machine.

Later, I will use Google Cloud API to compute distances. However, calling the
API is [not free](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing/) and is slow.
Then, it requires to filter first the stations which belong to our zone of
interest. The [Haversine
formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) is used to compute the
straight line (beeline) distance between the driver starting point and the all
the gas stations. Then, only the stations within this beeline(the maximum
distance depends on the user preference) are kept for further analysis.

### Compute cost of the filling

To get the number of Euros spent in the filling, I just have to multiply the
needed amount of gas(in L — also depending on user preference) by the price of
the gas(in €/L — the information is found in the scrapped data):

**TotalCost = GasUnitPrice∗GasVolume**

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/theme/img/post/gas_app/fill_up_table.png"  height="120">
<span class="figcaption_hack">Top 5 stations: Price of filling-up the tank</span>

At this point, I thought I was done but…

*“-So Dad, you can go to the first gas station on the list and you are going to
save money!*

-*Well, well, well… Son, you just gave me the different prices and ordered them.
Think about it, I’ll need to go there and come back from the gas station and
it’ll cost me gas in driving. Can you think about it?”*

### Compute cost of the filling including distance

Ok, so my Dad is really perfectionist! How can I take the distance into account?
I already computed the beeline distance… OK, but the roads are not straight
lines, thus I need to get the real distance the car will cover. So, I can use
the [Google Maps API](https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-python)
to compute the real distance between my dad and all the potential driving
stations. For the selected gas station, I used the
[distancematrix](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/start)
API request to get the real shortest distance between Dad and gas station.

First, for the selected gas stations, I used the
[distancematrix](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/start)
API request to get the real-distance between Dad and gas stations.

Then, the cost of the filling-up is:

**TotalCost = GasUnitPrice∗GasVolume + 2∗Distance∗CarGasConsumption**

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/theme/img/post/gas_app/fill_up_round_trip.png"  height="120">
<span class="figcaption_hack">Top 5 stations: Price of filling-up the tank including the round-trip</span>

Note: I count 2 times the ‘distance’ because I assume my Dad is doing a round
trip to the gas station.

*“Ok, Dad you’re right! It changed the order of the stations. Now I am done, you
can go re-fill your car.”*

### Include cost of time

At this point, I thought we were done… But:

*“Son, you know I am not that cheap! I can see I can save 1 € but it will take
me 3 more minutes… My time is also valuable, and you want to send me so far
away! I believe my time worths at least 0.5€ per minute. If I pay a small extra
cost for time-saving, I’ll prefer this solution!”*

This is how I came up with the time value cost. The idea is to compute the value
of the time spent to drive to a new station. Thanks to that, I can compute ‘his
personal cost’ to round-trip drive to the gas station.

The final cost of the filling-up is:

**TotalCost = GasUnitPrice∗GasVolume + 2∗CarGasConsumption∗Distance + 2∗TimeValue∗DrivingTime**

<span class="figcaption_hack">Top 5 stations: Price of filling-up the tank including the round-trip & time
value</span>

Note: Once again, I count 2 times the ‘distance’ and ‘time’ because I assume my
Dad is doing a round trip to the gas station.

“*Ok Dad, now I took into account the cost and the time, it’s finally done! And
look, the formula is pretty smart, the optimal station(136) is neither the
closest (272) nor the cheapest(126). This is really the optimal one given your
parameters.”*

### Driving Road

*“-Son… Actually, I have one more request… You gave me the name of the station
but I don’t know how to go there…*

*-Ok, Dad, let’s see if I can figure it out.”*

To do so, I used another amazing Google API features:
[direction](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/start).
Then, I am able to give you the road directions to refill the car.

<span class="figcaption_hack">Gas Stations in within the maximum beeline distance. In blue the “Cheapest”, in
purple the “Most Expensive”, in Green the “Optimum”. You can’t see the yellow
one which represents the “Closest” because it’s overlapped with the home marker.</span>

<span class="figcaption_hack">Direction to the Gas stations</span>

Now, I was feeling the job was done. I just sent my father the notebook.
However…

### Web-App

*“What is that stuff ?!? I don’t understand when I click on your file, it’s
displaying a strange text”*

This part has been the most time consuming. Fortunately, it was a real lesson on
how the world is working. My Dad, just like so many people, was unable to use a
raw Python file. I needed to create a
[GUI](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_graphique) for him. Indeed, as a
data scientist, the most important reward is to have an impact, and **if I want
to impact his life, I need to create tools he can easily use**. I am facing the
same problem during my internship where I need to work with CS and non-CS
people. However, this is another story, I hope to tell you more about it later!

My first idea to create the Graphic interface was to use
[Tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter) which is the most used GUI in
Python. However, I have been quickly limited by the fact Tkinter doesn’t allow
us to visualize HTML maps on the screen.

I finally opted for developing a Web-App using the [Flask
Framework](http://flask.pocoo.org/). I won’t go in details either on how to use
Flask nor on how to host the app online using
[Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/). (these links were amazing and did a
great job in teaching me how to do that:
[link1](https://xcitech.github.io/tutorials/heroku_tutorial/),
[link2](https://pythonspot.com/flask-web-forms/),
[link3](https://medium.com/the-andela-way/deploying-a-python-flask-app-to-heroku-41250bda27d0),
[link4](https://medium.com/python-pandemonium/build-simple-restful-api-with-python-and-flask-part-1-fae9ff66a706))

You can try the [app](https://gas-app-usa.herokuapp.com/), play with it and give
your feedbacks! And please, as it is hosted on Heroku for free, it can be
slightly slow at the launching. And please don’t select a too large max beeline
if you look into big cities, indeed, Heroku limits the time of computation.

<span class="figcaption_hack">Yeah dad, you almost saved 10€ by choosing the good station in your area!</span>

### Last Words

*“Thanks Son, well done! Enjoy your stay in the US and come whenever you want.
Now, we can ride together the car in our wonderful *[Aquitaine
