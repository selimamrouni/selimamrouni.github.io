In this Medium series, we will present our work as Research Interns this Summer
2018 at [NYU Langone Health](https://nyulangone.org/).

This article (Part. 1) will be focused on the general presentation of the
problem and a description of the hospital processes.

[Part.
2](https://medium.com/@thibault.duplay/predicting-hospital-bed-availability-part-2-4ebf1c037df1)
will be focused on the model used for predicting the hospital occupancy. So,
here we go into the core of the project!

### Internship Overview

> “ Predict the hospital bed availability in the next 72 hours…”

Capacity Planning, the prediction, and optimization of bed occupancy in a
hospital is a popular field. The **goal** is to **enhance** the **operation
process** and **improve efficiency** in the **health-care industry**.
Several hospitals, such as Cincinnati Children’s Hospital and Yale New Haven
Hospital, have already improved their operation system thanks to the Capacity
Planning.

As a hospital in a major city of the world, New York, NYULMC experienced several
**shortages of beds** (saturation of the bed availability). These **situations**
are extremely **annoying** that is why **predicting** in advance the **bed
occupancy** and then using these predictions to **optimize the patient
placement** is an interesting and useful problem.

Our goal has been to **predict** the bed **availability in the next 72 hours**
(for each day). <br> The model must be** re-calibrated** as the data arrives: we
do not know what will happen today, but tomorrow we will know everything about
what happened, so the model has to constantly re-fit its prediction with the
updated data.

### Comprehensive Transfer Center

> “Hospital Control Tower”

The **Comprehensive Transfer Center (CTC)** is a dozen-members-team which
**manages** **all patient-flow activities** throughout NYU Langone Health. It
manages transfers into and within NYU Langone Health in collaboration with
leadership and staff as well as interdisciplinary teams.<br> The CTC is compared
to the **“Control Tower”** of the hospital. The team is doing on a daily basis
an amazing job to ensure the **perfect** **management** of all the **bed’s
facilities in NYU**.

### Hospital Organization

<span class="figcaption_hack">[Tisch Hospital](https://med.nyu.edu/research/office-science-research/)</span>

NYU Langone owns 200 locations and 6 of them care for inpatients. The **scope**
of our project is limited to **3 of the inpatient units**: **Tisch** Hospital,
**Kimmel** Pavilion & **Hassenfeld** Children’s Hospital.<br> Before going
further, we first need to define a **nursing unit (NU)**. A NU is a **physical
subdivision of the hospital**. Each NU corresponds to a nurse desk.

Our **project granularity** is at a **NU level**: we need to forecast the
availability within each of the NU.

The project scope counts around **562** **beds** distributed in **21 NU**, each
NU is also subdivided in 3 according to the different level of care: (from
lowest to highest) Acute, Step Down & Intensive Care. The **patients** can,
therefore, be **allocated according to their service(Cardiology, Neurology,
etc…) and the level of care** they need. Usually, there are three to four NUs
available, the placement is aiming to increase the operation efficiency of the
hospital.

### Hospital Patient Flow

In order to predict bed demand, it is important to understand the hospital
**patients flow**. First of all, we need to create a simple scheme to understand
in which **state** a certain **patient** can be. This scheme can then be easily
modeled with Mathematics and be adjusted with the historical data.

The next figure illustrates the simplified mechanism of the hospital we chose
for our study. The real diagram is more complicated but the changes that are
induced are negligible in the scope of our project.

<span class="figcaption_hack">Diagram of the patients flow</span>

There are **two** **kinds** of **patients** at the **entrance**: the
**scheduled** (the ones that have an appointment at the hospital, mainly
surgeries) and the **unscheduled** (mainly the emergencies). After being seen by
the employees of the hospital, these patients **can occupy or not** a hospital
bed and become **inpatients** until being discharged. Since the goal of the
project is to predict the bed availability, the patients that do not occupy a
bed are not taken into account.

In order to estimate the future bed availability, we need to separate the
following cases:

* **Current inpatients**: We have access to a current snapshot of the inpatients,
based on this data we wish to assign a particular Length of Stay (LoS) to each
of the inpatients.
* **Upcoming scheduled**: We have access to the schedule of the next surgeries. We
have some information on these “scheduled” patients. Based on this schedule, we
will try to adjust the number of incoming scheduled inpatients and assign them a
LoS.
* **Upcoming unscheduled**: By nature these patients are random. Based on
historical data we will try to sample the upcoming arrivals in the Emergency
Room. With these simulations, we wish to adjust the number of incoming
unscheduled inpatients and assign them a LoS.

### **Model Framework**

#### Input

Four dataset sources have been used:

* **Current Census**: It is a snapshot of all the inpatients in the hospital at
the moment it has been pulled.
* **Discharges**: This is a dataset of the 2-last-months discharges, it is useful
to make statistics on the historical data.
* **OR Schedule**: It is a schedule where we can access upcoming surgeries within
15 days, we have access to the intensity of the care, the type of medicine, and
the hours of the surgeries. The NU is not assigned yet.
* **Placement Matrix**: This is a matrix often updated by the CTC team,
associating particular a type of medicine and a level of care to a NU.

#### Output

The outputs are little **tables** for **each nursing unit** separated into
**three** **different** **sources**: “scheduled”, “unscheduled” and “current
inpatients” that can be easily aggregated. The columns of the tables separate
six-time slots. Each time slot represents 12 hours (principally for morning and
afternoon). The timeline is starting today at 0:00 AM and is ending after
tomorrow at 12:00 PM. The rows of the tables separate the admissions, the
discharges and the total number of patients in the NU (coming from the
considered source) for each time slot.

#### **Aggregating the three sources**

In order to have a **prediction of the next 72 hours** for a particular NU
ignoring the source, we just have to **sum** the **tables** from the three
sources. If we want the prediction for a complete location (Tisch Hospital,
Kimmel Pavillon or Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital) we just have to sum the
tables of the corresponding NU.

### Conclusion

Et voila! In this first part, you had the opportunity to discover the hospital,
CTC organization & management and an introduction to our model. In the coming
articles, we will dig deeper into each part of the model, the use of word
distance to make the program robust to human inputs, the simulation of
unscheduled patients, the building of a Graphic User Interface and our
reflection to improve our tool.
